       <H1> How close are we to 1.5 degrees global mean warming?</H1>


<P>
The figure below shows monthly global mean temperatures (grey line) relative to the 1850-1900 pre-industrial mean together with a carefully constructed robust trend estimate (in red). The title gives the most recent estimate of
global mean warming (the rightmost point on the trend curve) and the most recent mean warming rate (the rightmost slope of the trend curve):
