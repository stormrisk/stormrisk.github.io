       <H1> How close are we to 1.5 degrees global mean warming?</H1>


<P>
The figure below shows monthly global mean temperatures (grey line) relative to the 1850-1900 pre-industrial mean together with a carefully constructed robust trend estimate (in red). The title gives the most recent estimate of
global mean warming (the rightmost point on the trend curve) and the most recent mean warming rate (the rightmost slope of the trend curve):

<H2>How I made this plot ...</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>I downloaded the most recent HadCRUT monthly mean global mean
  temperature data set from <A
  HREF="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut5">http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut5</A> at the
  Met Office
  </LI>
   <LI>I read the data into a data frame object in the R programming language</LI>
  <LI>I calculated the time mean over 1850-1900 and subtracted it from
  all the monthly values to make anomaly values</LI>
  <LI>I plotted the anomaly values (the grey line)</LI>
  <LI>I estimated a long-term trend (the red line) using LOESS (locallly
  estimated scatterplot smoothing) regression with a span of 0.2</LI>
</UL>

Note that estimates of global mean warming differ slightly depending
on various choices such as:
<UL>
  <LI>which global temperature data set to use (there are <A HREF="https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/global-temperature-data-sets-overview-comparison-table">several</A>)</LI>
   <LI>which period to use for the preindustrial mean e.g. 1850-1900</LI>
  <LI>which statistical model to use for the trend process</LI>
  <LI>what parameter values to use in the trend model</LI>
</UL>
