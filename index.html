				<h3><a name="research"></a>Welcome</h3>
Welcome to my personal home page - a place where can I tell you a
little more about myself than the outputs summarised on my work
			  website.</P>

I am a scientist/mathematician who likes to develop and apply
			  mathematical models to help understand the
			  world. I have 35 years of experience in
			  climate science and 30 years of experience
			  in statistical modelling. </P>
			  
As a young boy I spent a lot of time messing around on my own with scientific
hobbies: astronomy, chemistry, electronics, short wave radio. I
went on to study physics at University, which led to
me obtaining my doctorate in theoretical particle physics. I then
switched in 1989 to something less abstract - climate science. Around 1994, I
			  had
			  an epiphany realising that much of climate
			  research involved
			  statistical reasoning - an area of which I
			  had not had that much training in (as is
			  true of many other scientists). So since
			  then I endeavoured to learn more about
			  statistics, which has led me to become a
			  <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Stephenson_(climatologist)">professor of statistics</A> at the U. of Exeter. </P>

			  
I am interested in making intelligent use of statistical modelling to provide deeper insight into weather and climate processes and improve our ability to forecast and reduce risk. I particularly like developing and applying bespoke low-dimensional statistical models to inform science questions. </P>

These are some of the issues my recent research is currently addressing:
<UL>
			  <LI> <A HREF="gw.html">How close are we to 1.5 degrees global mean warming?</A>
    <LI> What are the best methods for determining future trends in climate modes of variability?
    <LI> What are the main drivers of collective risk for extreme storms?
		      </UL>
		      
I am happy to make new collaborations if I can add value to them so please email me if:
<UL>
 <LI>   You have a research project/proposal that could benefit from my insight;
 <LI>   You require consultancy advice on either climate change or storm risk;
 <LI>   You wish to do a PhD project under my supervision (and have self-funding).
 </UL>
