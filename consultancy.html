				<h2>Consultancy and Training</h2>
My work on the clustering of storms and floods has raised awareness in
			  the insurance industry about clustering, and
			  has stimulated major improvements in the
			  vendor catastrophe models, which are the
			  main tools used by insurance companies to
			  price windstorm insurance.
			  I was a founding member in 2006 of the <A
			  HREF="https://www.wtwco.com/en-gb/insights/research-programs-and-collaborations/wtw-research-network">WTW
			  research network</A>,
			  a major partnership between academia and the
			  insurance industry. The WRN’s research has
			  been valuable to the whole insurance
			  industry, which is a particularly successful
			  UK sector, employing around 315,000 people
			  and contributing nearly £12bn in tax
			  revenues in 2014.
Since 2010, I have served as the windstorm expert on the Advisory
			  Council on Catastrophes of Zurich Insurance
			  (one of the world’s largest insurers). In
			  2017, my advice on climate change risks
			  helped support their corporate decision to
			  divest from insuring the coal industry. </P>

I have also provided expert advice on several other consultancies
			  e.g. on temperature forecasts and extremes
			  for EDF France and Horizon Nuclear
			  Power. </P>

In addition to this consultancy work, I have also successfully
			  delivered many short bespoke training
			  courses on advanced statistical methods to
			  climate scientists at the U. of Bergen, the
			  UK Met Office, and the U. of Pavia. </P>

Please email me if you think my climate and statistical expertise
 might be of use to you either as a consultancy or training. </P>
